# Project Title
 Explore US Bikeshare Data
	
# Project Overview
  In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

# Software Requirements
  To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

  1. You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
  2. A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
  3. A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

# Data Sets
  1. chicago.csv
  2. new_york_city.csv
  3. washington 

# Statistics Computed 
  In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

    1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

         most common month
         most common day of week
         most common hour of day

    2. Popular stations and trip

         most common start station
         most common end station
         most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
      
    3. Trip duration

         total travel time
         average travel time

    4. User info

         counts of each user type
         counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
         earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
